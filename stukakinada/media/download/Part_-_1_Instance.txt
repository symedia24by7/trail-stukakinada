To Create a Instance of Vulkan API:
    -> Create a Private field of Vulkan Instance VkInstance
    -> Now Create VkApplication Struct and populate with its data
    -> Create Instance-create-info Struct and populate the data again
    -> To fill rest of the data we need extensions, so we will use glfw to query about extensions
    -> Rest of data is about Validation Layers which we will populate in Next Part!
    -> Now we can call vkCreateInstance function 
    -> After the application closes we need to clean up the object to relieve memory

Note:
    1)if any Struct field have "p" as prefix, for eg: pApplicationInfo
        then they need the pointer to that file i.e address of that object => &appInfo;
    
    2)Every vkCall Object Creation function have 3 parameters 
        -> Struct for data about what to do
        -> custom allocator("memory" if needed)
        -> variable of that object that we want to create

    3) Almost Every vkCall function will output VkResult, we can use this for checking,
        whether everything went right or wrong!
